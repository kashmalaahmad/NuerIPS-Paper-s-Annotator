This project is a Python-based tool that scrapes metadata from NeurIPS conference papers, including titles, authors, and other details, and stores them in a structured JSON file. The tool also downloads relevant PDFs, extracts text from them, and automatically categorizes each paper using the Gemini API. It helps organize research papers into defined categories like "Reinforcement Learning" or "Computer Vision," improving the searchability and efficiency of research analysis. The project includes robust error handling and retry logic to address API limitations and ensure the smooth operation of the data annotation process. for a few seconds
